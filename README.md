## What I learnt
Continuing from my learning of the ToDo List which I did for the Laravel Bootcamp, this project reienforced the knowledge I gained from that project.

From this project I learnt:

- Routing: Understanding and defining routes for different CRUD operations.
- Controllers: Creating controllers to handle business logic and interactions with models.
- Views: Using Blade templating engine to create dynamic and reusable views.
- Database Management: Working with migrations and seeders to set up and populate the database.
- Authentication: Implementing basic authentication features for user management.
- Form Handling: Validating user input and handling form submissions securely.


## Further Improvement

- Implementing advanced features like user comments, 
- categories, or tags for blog posts.
- Enhancing the frontend design and user interface.
- Optimizing database queries and performance.
- Adding more robust error handling and validation.
